Description of files and folders:

Task_1_codeFunctions_template.py:
=================================
* This is the code to be executed.
* Read and understand the code and the structure of the algorithm used.
* The code basically only allocates the arrays and calls functions imported from codeFunctions_template.py.
* Only change things in the "Inputs" part, according to your case description, except:
* If you implement the createAdditionalPlots() function you should also change the arguments to that function.
* It is possible to run the code as it is given, but the functions only provide placeholder data.

codeFunctions_template.py:
==========================
* This contains all the functions. A few have been implemented, but most of them you have to implement.
* The functions in the given code provide placeholder data so that Task_1_codeFunctions_template.py can be executed.
* Read the instructions at the beginning of the code.
* Read and understand the code.

test_codeFunctions_template.py:
===============================
* This can be executed to test your implementations of the functions.
* Executing the code does not influence the other codes.
* Read the instructions at the beginning of the code.
* If you execute the code with the given code for the functions you will get "NOT OK" for all functions and arrays.
* An advice is to make the functions work in the order the errors are reported.

refData:
========
* Contains input and output to be used by test_codeFunctions_template.py.
* It was generated for a non-equidistant mesh, so your code must work for such meshes to get OK.
* No reason to look at it. It will not give you any hints.

Figures:
========
* A directory that will be created when executing Task_1_codeFunctions_template.py, with the generated plots.
